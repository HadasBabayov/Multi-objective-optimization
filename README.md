# Multi-objective-optimization

Our project is about Multi-Objective optimization in genetics algorithms.

**Instructions for how to run and use the code:**
- Download 'main.py' from the git repo.
- Copy the code to an existing project or create a new one.
- Install the following packages: 
1.   numpy:
     - pip
     ```
     pip install numpy
     ```
     - conda
     ```
     conda install numpy
     ```
2.   pymoo:
     - pip
     ```
     pip install -U pymoo
     ```
     - conda
     ```
     conda create -n pymoo -y python==3.9 numpy
     conda activate pymoo
     pip install -U pymoo
     ```
3.  matplotlib:
    - pip
     ```
     pip install -U matplotlib
     ```
     - conda
     ```
     conda install matplotlib
     ```
- Now, run the code:
```
python main.py
```

**The results:**
After running the code you should see the result chart in the terminal and the graphs should pop up.
