# Multi-objective-optimization

Our project is about Multi-Objective optimization in genetics algorithems.

**Instructions for how to run and use the code:**
- Download 'main.py' from the git repo.
- copy the code to an existing project or create a new one.
- install the following packages: 
1.   numpy:
     - pip
     ```
     pip install numpy
     ```
     - conda
     ```
     conda install numpy
     ```
2.   pymoo:
     - pip
     - conda
```
pip install -U pymoo
```
```
conda create -n pymoo -y python==3.9 numpy
conda activate pymoo
pip install -U pymoo
```
3.  matplotlib:
    - pip
    - conda
```
pip install -U matplotlib
```
```
conda install matplotlib
```
- now, run the code:
